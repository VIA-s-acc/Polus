### Task: Solving the Linear System $ Ax = b $
#### Description
A parallel program should be developed using MPI to solve the system of linear algebraic equations (SLAE):

$$Ax = b$$


where $ A $ is a square matrix of size $ n \times n $, $ x $ is the vector of unknowns, and $ b $ is the vector of right-hand side values.

The solution should be obtained using the Jacobi method, which is iterative. The accuracy of the solution is defined by the parameter $ \epsilon $, which specifies the acceptable error. The elements of matrix $ A $ and vector $ b $ should be read from files, where the matrix size $ A $ is $ n \times n $, and the vector $ b $ has size $ n $. The matrix size $ n $ should be passed as a parameter in the command line.

#### Requirements:
1. **MPI Implementation**: The program must use MPI for parallel execution across multiple processes.
2. **Data Distribution**: The elements of matrix $ A $ should be distributed across processes in a banded fashion, with each process handling $ n/p $ rows, where $ p $ is the number of processes.
3. **Data Input**: The size of matrix $ A $ and vector $ b $ is determined from the file $ A.dat $, which should be provided to the program. All data should be read correctly and distributed among the processes.
4. **Solution Accuracy**: The solution must achieve the specified accuracy $ \epsilon $, and the program should stop when the difference between iterations is smaller than the given precision.
5. **Command Line Parameters**:
   - Accuracy $ \epsilon $
   - Filenames for matrix $ A $ and vector $ b $
   - Matrix size $ n $ (passed as a parameter in the command line)
6. **Performance Measurement**: A graph of the programâ€™s speedup should be generated based on the number of processes, using the specified value of $ \epsilon $.

#### Jacobi Method
The Jacobi method is an iterative technique for solving systems of linear equations. The formula used is:

$$
x_i^{(k+1)} = \frac{1}{A_{ii}} \left( b_i - \sum_{j \neq i} A_{ij} x_j^{(k)} \right)
$$

where $ x_i^{(k+1)} $ is the updated value of the $ i $-th element of the vector $ x $ at the $ k+1 $-th iteration, $ A_{ij} $ are the elements of matrix $ A $, and $ b_i $ are the elements of vector $ b $.

#### Expected Output:
- The source code for solving the SLAE using the Jacobi method with MPI.
- Matrix $ A $ and vector $ b $ used in the program.
- A graph showing the speedup of the program as a function of the number of processes $ p $, illustrating the performance improvement with increasing process count.

## CLI
### System generation

For the system generation, use <a href="prac/generator.py"><button>generator.py</button></a>

- CLI Interface:
```bash
usage: generator.py [-h] -n N [-m {auto,manual}] [--x X] [-A A] [-b B] [-p]

Generation of matrix A and vector b for solving Ax = b by vector x

options:
  -h, --help        show this help message and exit
  -n N              System dimension (n)
  -m {auto,manual}  Method of generating vector x (auto/manual)
  --x X             Vector x as a comma-separated list (only for manual)      
  -A A              Name of the file for matrix A (default A.bat)
  -b B              Name of the file for vector b (default b.bat)
  -p                Flag to print result to the screen
```

---
### Program run
Run the program using the following command:

```bash
mpixlc -o "$program" "$source"
mpisubmit.pl -p "$num_proc" ./"$program" -- N="$N" eps="$eps" A="$A" b="$b"
```
or using script <a href="prac/run.sh"><button>run.sh</button></a>
```bash
usage: script.sh [-h] -p NUM_PROC -N N -eps EPS -A A -b B -source SOURCE -program PROGRAM

Options:
  -h, --help        Show this help message and exit
  -p NUM_PROC       Number of processes (required)
  -N N              System dimension (required)
  -eps EPS          Precision for calculations (required)
  -A A              Name of the file for matrix A (required)
  -b B              Name of the file for vector b (required)
  -source SOURCE    Path to the source code for compilation (required)
  -program PROGRAM  Name of the compiled program (required)
```

Result will be in the file `result.dat`, and in file `times.dat`
it will be the time spent on calculations and the number of processes.

### Graph
A graph showing the acceleration of the program as a function of the number of processes $ p $, with the calculation time not including the time spent on reading data from a file and writing the result to a file.

![acceleration](Graph/Figure_1.png)

$$
A: \mathbb{R}^{1500} \to \mathbb{R}^{1500}, \quad A x = b \newline
$$
$$
A \in \mathbb{R}^{1500 \times 1500}, \quad x \in \mathbb{R}^{1500}, \quad b \in \mathbb{R}^{1500}
$$
Next, let $ p $ be a natural number from 1 to 20 (inclusive), where $ p $ is the number of processes. Then, define the acceleration as:
$$
S(p) = \frac{T(1)}{T(p)}
$$
where $ T(p) $ is the time spent on $ p $ processes, and $ T(1) $ is the time spent on one process.

For the construction of the graphics, interpolation methods were used. These include linear, quadratic, and cubic interpolation, which are widely applied to approximate unknown functions based on known data points.

#### Linear Interpolation
---
Linear interpolation assumes that the function is a straight line between two data points. The general formula for linear interpolation is:

$$
f(x) = y_0 + \frac{(x - x_0)}{(x_1 - x_0)} (y_1 - y_0)
$$

where $
 (x_0, y_0) $
 and $
 (x_1, y_1) $
 are the given data points.

#### Quadratic Interpolation
---
Quadratic interpolation fits a second-degree polynomial through three given data points. The general formula for quadratic interpolation is:

$$
f(x) = a_2 x^2 + a_1 x + a_0
$$

The coefficients $a_0, a_1, a_2 $
are determined by solving a system of equations derived from the conditions that the function passes through the three data points.

#### Cubic Interpolation
---
Cubic interpolation uses a third-degree polynomial to approximate the function between four data points. The general formula for cubic interpolation is:

$$
f(x) = a_3 x^3 + a_2 x^2 + a_1 x + a_0
$$

The coefficients $
 a_0, a_1, a_2, a_3 $
 are determined by solving a system of equations that ensure the function passes through the four data points and satisfies the necessary smoothness conditions (first and second derivatives at the points).
